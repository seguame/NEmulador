    // memory, some of which are direct and some are indirect (like
    // pointers in C++). Each opcode contains information about which
    // addressing mode should be employed to facilitate the
    // instruction, in regards to where it reads/writes the data it
    // uses. The address mode changes the number of bytes that
    // makes up the full instruction, so we implement addressing
    // before executing the instruction, to make sure the program
    // counter is at the correct location, the instruction is
    // primed with the addresses it needs, and the number of clock
    // cycles the instruction requires is calculated. These functions
    // may adjust the number of cycles required depending upon where
    // and how the memory is accessed, so they return the required
    // adjustment.

    // is as the developers intended it to be.
    // Unofficial codes will of course also influence the CPU
    // circuitry in interesting ways, and can be exploited to gain
    // additional functionality!
    //
    // These functions return 0 normally, but some are capable of
    // requiring more clock cycles when executed under certain
    // conditions combined with certain addressing modes. If that is
    // the case, they return 1.
